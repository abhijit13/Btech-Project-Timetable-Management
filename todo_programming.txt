									***bugs***
		//saving on disk and opening 
			if len(sel__dict__) changes, it need to be updated again.
		//after opeing a file when you do new, old tt should disappear
			restarting program to do this... find better way 
			(checked with len(self.__dict__) may change over time change it at last)
		//slot merging
			background cells are active, take care while using it
		//batches not working
			//for teacher and venue
		//deleting entries from grid with ui
			//cant delete batches properly
			//batches can be deleted from class only, other's slot gets empty

	**For ODS/PDF **
	UI Design:

	For classwise timetable:
		show default venue in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and venue it its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class
		show mappings on next page

	For Venuewise timetable:
		show default class in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class if its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class		

	For Teacherwise timetable:
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class (batch if applicable)
			and venue
		therory load/lab load/total load
