									***bugs***
		saving on disk and opening 
			changed globals, so wont work properly
		deleting entries from grid with ui
			cant delete batches properly
			batches can be deleted from class only, from teacher, venue entire slot will be emptied
		header info
			cant change during runtime
		after opeing a file when you do new, old tt should disappear
			restarting program to do this... find better way (checked with default # of args might change over time change it at last)
		faculty subject/batch mapping, venue class mapping
			1-1 mapping, cant map faculty to mulitple subjects
