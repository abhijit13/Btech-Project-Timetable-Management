									***bugs***
		saving on disk and opening 
			changed globals, so wont work properly
		after opeing a file when you do new, old tt should disappear
			restarting program to do this... find better way (checked with default # of args might change over time change it at last)
		change in working days/week, lectures/day
			doesnt reflect on existing timetable
		slot merging
			may contain lot of bugs, test it throughly

		//batches not working
			//for teacher and venue
		//deleting entries from grid with ui
			//cant delete batches properly
			//batches can be deleted from class only, from teacher, venue entire slot gets empty
		//pubsub error

	**For ODS/PDF **
	UI Design:

	For classwise timetable:
		show default venue in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and venue it its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class
		show mappings on next page

	For Venuewise timetable:
		show default class in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class if its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class		

	For Teacherwise timetable:
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class (batch if applicable)
			and venue
		therory load/lab load/total load
