								***bugs***

	//new wizard -> headers, basic constraints, popup for data
	//data --> teachers, venue, classes, subjects
	//suggestions dropdown box for teacher/venue/class names
	//subject credits = max lectures 
	//arrange globals in global file
	//what aboout batches - in the format as syc-b1, syc-b2
	//heading of tt -- as tt of teacher / tt of venue / tt of class
	//teacher load individually
	//venue capacity checking (soft constraint) venue of 70 cap and class of 90 not fair
	//statistics venue utilization - day/week wise
	//lunch check in ui- lunch is explicit i.e. empty slot does not mean its lunch time
	//default entry from which we got popup	
	//copy paste cut paste
	//faculty subject/batch mapping 1-1 mapping only
	//discard global input after first entry
		//no global input - first entry will appear on adding first teacher / venue / class
	//teacher, venue, class list should be imported from file
	//view of grid
		//scroll bars when not required. grid takes less space than available and shows scrollbars
	//teacher lunch break
		No batches here cause not required
	//basic constraints remove teacher constraints
	//cant cancel the dialouge
	//saving on disk and opening 
		if len(sel__dict__) changes, it need to be updated again.
	//after opeing a file when you do new, old tt should disappear
		restarting program to do this... find better way 
		(checked with len(self.__dict__) may change over time change it at last)
	//slot merging
		background cells are active, take care while using it
	//batches not working
		//for teacher and venue
	//deleting entries from grid with ui
		//cant delete batches properly
		//batches can be deleted from class only, other's slot gets empty
	//teacher load should be soft constraint
	//warning list  for soft constraints violation
	// temp word should be avoided, treat is as keyword

	**For ODS/PDF **
	UI Design:

	For classwise timetable:
		show default venue in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and venue it its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class
		show mappings on next page

	For Venuewise timetable:
		show default class in header
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class if its not default
			and batches if its not for whole class		

	For Teacherwise timetable:
		in grid show only name of subject 
			and class (batch if applicable)
			and venue
		therory load/lab load/total load
